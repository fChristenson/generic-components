# How to build reusable components in React

## What we will cover

- A mental mistake some make when creating components
- Why I believe it happens
- How to fix it

## Notes

One of the most common things I have noticed when working with developers in frontend is
that when they are designing their components their component often turns out as a "one
of solution".

This means that the component can not be directly reused without changing the code.

A mental trick I use to help me design more generic components is to always think from
the perspective of the component and not about my data.
